## Big-O notation allows is to compare algorithms independently of input size

#### Comparing Search Algorithms

Algo 1:
- The item we are searching for will be the first or last element in the list 
- Best case: O(1) or constant time 
- Worst case O(1)

Algo 2: 
- The item we are searching for could be anywhere within the list 
- Best case: O(n) first item checked 
- Worst case: O(n) or linear | item not in list 


#### Time Complexities 
- O(1) or constant time 
- O(log(n)) or logarithmic time
- O(n) or linear time 
- O(n^2) or exponential time 
- O(n!) or factorial time
