# Algorithms

- Algorithms give a set of instructions to perform a task
- They give programs a set of instructions to perform a task 

## String Algos
- A common programming task is to search for a piece of data within a string 

- What Assumptions can you make?
    - If you know nothing about the string you have to check ever character 
    - If the string's characters are sorted, you can optimize your algorithm based on order 

- Regardless what assumptions you make, you'll need to be able to parse a string's contents 

- The LEAST complex and least efficient way to search for a subset of strings within a string is to use the built in contains method 

- Another type of software task is to create a new string based on input data
